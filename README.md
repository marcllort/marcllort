I am a Computer Engineer with two+ years of experience in backend microservices development. During my time at university, Iâ€™ve worked on countless personal projects (check my [Github repos](https://github.com/marcllort?tab=repositories)!), which allowed me to realize my strengths and interests.

Iâ€™ve always been a great problem solver (good googler), quick learner, and a technophile obsessed with the latest devices. Now Iâ€™m working as a DevOps engineer, and I get to show off all these elements of who I am.

During my time as a software developer, I worked with Java (SpringBoot) and Golang. Other languages and technologies I have experience with are RabbitMQ, MySQL, and Python.

Now, as a DevOps engineer, I get to work every day with Linux, multiple CI/CD providers (Jenkins, BB Pipelines, Gitlab CI/CD), AWS and GCP, Kubernetes, Prometheus/Grafana, Terraform, Nexus, Docker, Bash, and many others.

Iâ€™m still adding new technologies and projects to my tech stack every day, with no intention to stop!

âš¡ If you want to check out some of my projects, I would say the most interesting are [CarRental](https://github.com/marcllort/Car_Rental_Monorepo) and [CanITravelTo](https://github.com/marcllort/CanITravelTo_Backend).
